      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <h3>What is Tailwind CSS?</h3>
      <p>
        Tailwind CSS works by scanning all of your HTML files, JavaScript
        components, and any other templates for class names, generating the
        corresponding styles and then writing them to a static CSS file.

      <h3>How to Use CSS</h3>
      <p>
        Traditionally, whenever you need to style something on the web, you
        write CSS.
      </p>
      <p>
        With Tailwind, you style elements by applying pre-existing classes
        directly in your HTML.
